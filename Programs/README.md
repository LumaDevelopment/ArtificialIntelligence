# Programs

These are programs I've made to reinforce concepts taught in class.

- `SlidingPuzzle` - Data structures and algorithms for the representation and solution of the *n*-puzzle problem.
- `FibonacciComparison` - A comparison of the performance of the recursive and iterative implements of the Fibonacci
  sequence algorithm.
