# Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

Our project goal:

```
Select analyze 100 equally sampled MNIST digits (10 for each digit) with a TDA software (Mapper in Scikit Learn). For 
example, some handwritten 9â€™s may look like a 0, they should show up closer together in your TDA visualization.
```

## Components

- Presentation - Outlines the project, including a brief introduction to TDA, a description of the MNIST dataset, 
  and an explanation of our implementation, innovations, results, and findings.
- Code - The Jupyter Notebook used to produce many of the figures used in the presentation. Uses the MNIST dataset, 
  performs automatic selection and formatting of data, performs scaling and dimension reduction on data, and 
  does both automatic and manual mapping, where mapping is the process of creating a cover of the data, 
  clustering it, and creating a graph. For more information, please see the Presentation.
- Project Proposal - Our initial work of this project, and a more in-depth exploration of the concepts covered 
  in the presentation.
- Presentation Output - Figures and HTML files generated by [<code>matplotlib</code>](https://matplotlib.org/) and 
  [<code>KeplerMapper</code>](https://kepler-mapper.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/index.html), used in the Presentation.
