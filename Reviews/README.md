# Reviews

Over the course of the semester, I hosted review sessions with the following objectives:

- To improve, enhance, and refine my understanding of course material.
- To help my classmates improve, enhance, and refine their understanding of course material.
- To hone my skills as a teacher.

My presentation decks for those sessions are hosted in this folder.
