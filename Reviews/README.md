# Reviews

Over the course of the semester, I hosted review sessions with the following objectives:

1. To improve, enhance, and refine my understanding of course material.
2. To help my classmates improve, enhance, and refine my classmates' understanding of course material.
3. To hone my skills as a teacher.

My presentation decks for those sessions are hosted in this folder.
